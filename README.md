# Library

This is a virtual library app for displaying books on a page. It is written with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The main purpose was to learn about objects and work with object prototypes. Each book displayed on the page is it's own book object.

Once a book is displayed you have the ability to remove the book and toggle if the book has been read or not. Removing the book from the page removes the book from the Library array. Toggling the read status calls a book prototype function and changes the value of the objects read property.
